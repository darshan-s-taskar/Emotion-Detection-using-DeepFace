# Emotion-Detection-using-DeepFace-library
## This project aims towards detecting human emotion and displaying the dominant emotion using DeepFace library in python.
## This project performs real-time emotion detection using a webcam by leveraging the DeepFace library and OpenCV. It detects human faces and predicts emotions such as happy, sad, angry, neutral, etc., using a pre-trained deep learning model.
